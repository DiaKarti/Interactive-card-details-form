## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

By far I what I found to be the hardest thing thing in this challenge was styling the two cards to appear good in most screen sizes, which required media queries, CSS grid and a heafty dose of the CSS "clamp()" function. And overall, I think I didn't do half bad in replicating the original design.
Implementing an appropriate form validation took most of the dev time (even though I know client-side validation is practically usseless in an actual site), but I think it was worth it.


### Continued development

Following the completion of this project, I would like to focus on making full sites from scratch, as that appears to me to be the next logical conclusion.

### Useful resources

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io) - This is hands down one of the best resources for an aspiring web dev; ton of documentation for a plethora of languages and especially useful for people who forget their syntax, like me.
